Quick project summary (so you can pick up later)
Sprite preparation

You placed player.png (Enel) in frontend/public/sprites/.
Ran node remove_bg.js (now targeting player.png) to make the background fully transparent.
Map rendering tweaks

IslandMap.tsx now:
Allows sprites to overflow their tile (overflow‑visible).
Scales the player sprite to 0.5× its original size, anchored at the bottom so it sits on the ground.
Uses a larger container (w‑12 h‑12 sm:w‑14 sm:h‑14) with a drop‑shadow for visual polish.
Backend

No changes needed; the backend already serves the sprite file unchanged.
Next steps (when you’re ready)

Layered customization UI: add a character‑creation screen where users can pick body, hair, eyes, outfit layers and store the selected IDs in the new appearance* fields (to be added to the Prisma schema).
Database schema: extend Character with appearanceBody, appearanceHair, appearanceEyes, appearanceOutfit (strings) and run npx prisma db push.
API: adjust POST /api/character/create to accept those fields and return them in GET /api/character/:userId.
Frontend: build a preview component that stacks the selected layers (using position: absolute), similar to the player‑sprite rendering logic you just edited.
That’s everything you’ve done so far and a clear path forward for the full layered character system. Feel free to let me know when you want to dive into the next piece!
